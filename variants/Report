# Session 5: Mapping and variant calling

## Exe1: Results
I successfully performed variant calling using freebayes on Oryza sativa data. 
The process identified multiple variants (SNPs/Indels) on chromosome 10.

## Problems faced
I encountered permission issues when trying to write output files within the Docker container 
environment, which I resolved by directing output to accessible directories.
