# Session 1: Annotation of coding sequences

## Exe1: Database Formatting
I formatted the \`uniprot_Atha.fasta\` database.
- **Number of sequences:** 15,719 sequences were formatted.
- **Impact on E-value:** The size of the database directly affects the E-value. As the database becomes larger, the E-value for a given match increases. This is because a larger search space makes it more likely to find a high-scoring alignment by pure chance.
